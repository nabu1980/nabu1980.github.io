        <p><em>Mayonnaise</em> is a French cuisine appellation that seems to have
          appeared for the first time in 1806. The hypotheses invoked over
          time as to the origin(s) of mayonnaise have been
          numerous and contradictory. <br> <br>
          According to Émile Littré, it may have come from Mahón, capital of Menorca,
          in the Balearic Islands, occupied by the English and then conquered by the
          Duc de Richelieu in 1756. His cook would have presented him with this sauce,
          called the “mahonnaise”, made with the only two ingredients he had: egg
          and oil. Nevertheless, this sauce was starting to be described a little
          before this event while several versions of similar sauces existed in
          France and in Spain. <br> <br>
          Mayonnaise sauce may have its origins in the ancient remoulade. Another
          hypothesis would have it derive from aioli. Finally, the process of
          emulsifying egg yolk was known for a long time to pharmacists, who
          used it to prepare ointments and salves. <br> <br>
          Remoulade sauce was known for a long time and there were hot and cold
          versions of it: in both cases, the base was oil, vinegar, salt, herbs,
          often other ingredients such as capers or anchovies, and then mustard;
          in short, it was just an enriched vinaigrette. <br>
          In the early 18th century, Vincent La Chapelle had the idea of incorporating
          "velouté", based on roux, a mixture of flour and fat, to bind it. In 1742,
          François Marin published in the Suite des Dons de Comus a recipe called
          "beurre de Provence" which contains garlic cloves cooked in water, crushed
          with salt, pepper, capers and anchovies, then mixed with oil. This recipe is
          also close to the aioli, the egg yolk appearing later. <br>
          In 1750, Francesc Roger Gomila, a Valencian friar, published a recipe for
          a sauce similar to mayonnaise in Art de la Cuina ('The Art of Cooking').
          He calls the sauce aioli bo.<sup>[5]</sup> If he does not describe precisely the recipe
          - suggesting that it was known by everyone on the island -, the way it is
          used, the preparations for which it is used as a base and the dishes with
          which it is associated are most often inconceivable with an aioli. Earlier
          recipes of similar emulsified sauces, usually bearing garlic, appear in a
          number of Spanish recipe books, dating all the way back to the 14th century
          Llibre de Sent Soví, where it is called all-i-oli, literally 'garlic and oil'
          in Catalan.<sup>[6][7]</sup> This sauce had clearly spread throughout the Crown of Aragon,
          for Juan de Altamiras gives a recipe for it in his celebrated 1745 recipe book
          Nuevo Arte de Cocina ('New Art of Cooking').<sup>[8]</sup> <br>
          On April 18, 1756, the Duke of Richelieu invaded Menorca and took the port
          of Mahon. A theory states that the aioli bo sauce was thereafter adopted by
          the cook of the Duke of Richelieu, who upon his return to France made the
          sauce famous in the French court.[9] which would have been known as mahonnaise.
          <sup>[10][11][12]</sup> A number of legends arose relating how the Duke of
          Richelieu first tried the sauce, including his discovery of the sauce in a
          local inn of Mahon where he would have allegedly asked the innkeeper to make
          him some dinner during the siege of Mahon,<sup>[13]</sup> and even that he invented it
          himself as a quick garnish.<sup>[11]</sup> <br>
          Another version is Grimod de La Reynière's 1808 bayonnaise sauce which is a
          sort of aspic: "But if one wants to make from this cold chicken, a dish of
          distinction, one composes a bayonnaise, whose green jelly, of a good consistency,
          forms the most worthy ornament of poultry and fish salads."
          <sup>[14][non-primary source needed]</sup> <br>
          In 1806, André Viard, in Le Cuisinier impérial, transformed this recipe for
          remoulade by replacing the roux with egg yolk.<sup>[15]</sup> In another recipe, an Indian
          remoulade, without mustard, he specifies that the binding is facilitated by
          incorporating the oil little by little. This would be the first modern mention
          of a stable cold emulsified sauce.<sup>[16]</sup> In the same book, he also proposes a
          sauce called mayonnaise (the first recorded attestation of the name) but which
          is not an emulsion but a sauce linked to velouté and jelly. <br>
          It is only in 1815 that Antonin Carême mentions a cold "magnonaise"
          emulsified with egg yolk. The word "mayonnaise" is attested in English in 1815.<sup>[17]</sup> <br>
          Auguste Escoffier wrote that mayonnaise was a French mother sauce of cold
          sauces,<sup>[18]</sup> just like Espagnole or Velouté. </p>
