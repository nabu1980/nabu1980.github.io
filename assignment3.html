      <h1>Mayonnaise</h1>
      <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
      <p>Mayonnaise, colloquially referred to as "mayo", <sup>[1]</sup>
        is a thick, creamy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce">sauce</a>
        or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_dressing">dressing</a>
        commonly used on sandwiches, hamburgers, composedsalads, and French fries.
        It also forms the base for various othersauces, such as tartar sauce,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry_sauce">fry sauce</a>,
        remoulade, salsa golf, androuille.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
      <p>Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar
        or lemon juice;<sup>[3]</sup> there are many variants using additional flavorings.
        The color varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a
        light cream to a thick gel.</p>
      <p>Commercial imitations are made for vegans and those who avoid chicken
        eggs or dietary cholesterol<sup>[4]</sup> as well as people with egg allergies.</p>

          <p>Standard ingredients and tools to make mayonnaise</p>
        </aside>
        <p><em>Mayonnaise</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine">French cuisine</a>
          appellation that seems to have appeared for the first time in 1806.
          The hypotheses invoked over time as to the origin(s) of mayonnaise have been
          numerous and contradictory. <br> <br>

          According to Émile Littré, it may have come from Mahón, capital of Menorca,
          in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balearic_Islands">Balearic Islands</a>,
          occupied by the English and then conquered by theDuc de Richelieu in 1756.
          His cook would have presented him with this sauce, called the “mahonnaise”,
          made with the only two ingredients he had: egg and oil. Nevertheless,
          this sauce was starting to be described a little before this event while
          several versions of similar sauces existed in France and in Spain. <br> <br>

          Mayonnaise sauce may have its origins in the ancient
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remoulade">remoulade.</a> Another
          hypothesis would have it derive from aioli. Finally, the process of
          emulsifying egg yolk was known for a long time to pharmacists, who
          used it to prepare ointments and salves. <br> <br>

          Remoulade sauce was known for a long time and there were hot and cold
          versions of it: in both cases, the base was oil, vinegar, salt, herbs,
          often other ingredients such as capers or anchovies, and then mustard;
          in short, it was just an enriched
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinaigrette">vinaigrette</a>. <br> <br>

          In the early 18th century, Vincent La Chapelle had the idea of incorporating
          "velouté", based on roux, a mixture of flour and fat, to bind it. In 1742,
          François Marin published in the <em>Suite des Dons de Comus</em> a recipe called
          "beurre de Provence" which contains garlic cloves cooked in water, crushed
          with salt, pepper, capers and anchovies, then mixed with oil. This recipe is
          also close to the aioli, the egg yolk appearing later. <br> <br>

          In 1750, Francesc Roger Gomila, a Valencian friar, published a recipe for
          a sauce similar to mayonnaise in <em>Art de la Cuina</em> ('The Art of Cooking').
          He calls the sauce <em>aioli bo</em>.<sup>[5]</sup> If he does not describe precisely the recipe
          - suggesting that it was known by everyone on the island -, the way it is
          used, the preparations for which it is used as a base and the dishes with
          which it is associated are most often inconceivable with an aioli. Earlier
          recipes of similar emulsified sauces, usually bearing garlic, appear in a
          number of Spanish recipe books, dating all the way back to the 14th century
          Llibre de Sent Soví, where it is called all-i-oli, literally 'garlic and oil'
          in Catalan.<sup>[6][7]</sup> This sauce had clearly spread throughout the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon">Crown of Aragon,</a>
          for Juan de Altamiras gives a recipe for it in his celebrated 1745 recipe book
          <em>Nuevo Arte de Cocina</em> ('New Art of Cooking').<sup>[8]</sup> <br> <br>

          On April 18, 1756, the Duke of Richelieu invaded Menorca and took the port
          of Mahon. A theory states that the <em>aioli bo</em> sauce was thereafter adopted by
          the cook of the Duke of Richelieu, who upon his return to France made the
          sauce famous in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles">French</a>
          court.[9] which would have been known as <em>mahonnaise</em>.
          <sup>[10][11][12]</sup> A number of legends arose relating how the Duke of
          Richelieu first tried the sauce, including his discovery of the sauce in a
          local inn of Mahon where he would have allegedly asked the innkeeper to make
          him some dinner during the siege of Mahon,<sup>[13]</sup> and even that he invented it
          himself as a quick garnish.<sup>[11]</sup> <br> <br>

          Another version is
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Balthazar_Laurent_Grimod_de_La_Reyni%C3%A8re">Grimod de La Reynière</a>'s
          1808 <em>bayonnaise</em> sauce which is a
          sort of aspic: "But if one wants to make from this cold chicken, a dish of
          distinction, one composes a bayonnaise, whose green jelly, of a good consistency,
          forms the most worthy ornament of poultry and fish salads."
          <sup>[14][non-primary source needed]</sup> <br> <br>

          In 1806, André Viard, in Le Cuisinier impérial, transformed this recipe for
          remoulade by replacing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux">roux</a>
          with egg yolk.<sup>[15]</sup> In another recipe, an <em>Indian
          remoulade</em>, without mustard, he specifies that the binding is facilitated by
          incorporating the oil little by little. This would be the first modern mention
          of a stable cold emulsified sauce.<sup>[16]</sup> In the same book, he also proposes a
          sauce called <em>mayonnaise</em> (the first recorded attestation of the name) but which
          is not an emulsion but a sauce linked to velouté and jelly. <br> <br>

          It is only in 1815 that
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Antoine_Car%C3%AAme">Antonin Carême</a>
          mentions a cold "magnonaise" emulsified with egg yolk. The word "mayonnaise"
          is attested in English in 1815.<sup>[17]</sup> <br> <br>

          Auguste Escoffier wrote that mayonnaise was a French
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Mother_Sauces">mother sauce</a>
          of cold sauces,<sup>[18]</sup> just like Espagnole or Velouté. </p>

      <h2 id="etym">Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          Regarding the etymology of the name, the origin is unclear, it seems to appear
          for the first time in 1806. The hypotheses invoked over time as to its origin
          have been numerous, contradictory, and all the more difficult to untangle because
          their authors were prestigious. <br><br>

          A common theory is that it is named for Port Mahon, (Maó in Menorquín) itself named
          after its founder Mago Barca,<sup>[19][20]</sup> in Menorca, in honor of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_de_Vignerot_du_Plessis">3rd Duke of Richelieu</a>'s
          victory over the British in 1756, and in fact the name "mahonnaise" is used by
          some authors. But the name is only attested several decades after that
          event.<sup>[21][22]</sup> One version of this theory says that it was originally known
          as <em>salsa mahonesa</em> in Spanish,<sup>[23][24]</sup> but that spelling too is only attested later.<sup>[22]</sup> <br> <br>

          Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière, a lawyer by qualification
          who acquired fame during the reign of Napoleon for his sensual and public
          gastronomic lifestyle, rejected the name "mayonnaise" because the word
          "is not French". He also rejected the name "mahonnaise" because Port Mahon
          "is not known for good food", and thus he preferred "bayonnaise", after
          the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne">Bayonne</a>,
          which "has many innovative gourmands and... produces the best hams in Europe."
          <sup>[25][22]</sup> Indeed , the city of Bayonne (sauce "à la Bayonnaise")
          could also have given its name to this type of sauce, by spelling deformation.
          This form would seem to be confirmed by the fact that there is no written
          record of the sauce "à la mayonnaise" before the beginning of the 19th century,
          long after the capture of the city of Mahón.<sup>[26]</sup> <br> <br>

          Another hypothesis is based, according to Marie-Antoine Carême, a famous
          contemporary French chef, on a derivative of "magnonaise" (from the verb
          "magner", or "manier") or, according to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosper_Montagn%C3%A9">Prosper Montagné</a>
          , of "moyeunaise" (or "moyennaise"), based on "moyeu(x)" (or "moyen") which means
          "egg yolk", in Old French. It has also been suggested that the word be linked to
          the old verb "mailler", meaning "to beat".<sup>[27]</sup> <br> <br>

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Favre">Joseph Favre</a>, for his
          part, states in his memoirs that mayonnaise is an alteration of the word
          "magnonnaise", derived from Magnon (Lot-et-Garonne), and that a cook from
          Magnon would have popularized it first in the South of France; he notes that
          this sauce has been named indifferently mahonnaise, bayonnaise and mayonnaise.<sup>[28]</sup> <br> <br>

          A more controversial hypothesis, put forward by the linguist and historian Nicolas
          Lepreux, suggests that mayonnaise originated in the Mayenne region, and that the "e"
          would have changed into an "o" over time: the apocryphal story tells that the Duke
          of Mayenne would have abused too much the day before the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arques">battle of Arques</a> of
          chickens seasoned with a remarkable sauce, so that the next day he fell off his
          horse and lost the battle. <br> <br>
        </p>

      <h2 id="prep">Preparation</h2>
        <p>Recipes for mayonnaise date back to the early nineteenth century. In 1815,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Eustache_Ude">Louis Eustache Ude</a> wrote:</p>
        <blockquote>
          No 58.—Mayonnaise. Take three spoonfuls of Allemande, six ditto of aspic, and
          two of oil. Add a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarragon">tarragon</a>
          vinegar, that has not boiled, some pepper and salt, and minced ravigotte, or merely
          some parsley. Then put in the members of fowl, or fillets of soles, &c. Your mayonnaise
          must be put to ice; neither are you to put the members into your sauce till it begins
          to freeze. Next dish your meat or fish, mask with the sauce before it be quite
          frozen, and garnish your dish with whatever you think proper, as beet root, jelly,
          nasturtiums, &c.<sup>[29]</sup>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In an 1820 work, Viard describes something like the more familiar emulsified version: </p>
        <blockquote>
          This sauce is made to "take" in many ways: with raw egg yolks, with gelatine, with veal
          or veal brain glaze. The most common method is to take a raw egg yolk in a small terrine,
          with a little salt and lemon juice: take a wooden spoon, turn it while letting a trickle
          of oil fall and stirring constantly; as your sauce thickens, add a little vinegar; put
          in too a pound of good oil: serve your sauce with good salt: serve it white or green,
          adding green of ravigote or green of spinach. This sauce is used for cold fish entrees,
          or salad of vegetables cooked in salt water.<sup>[30]</sup>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Modern mayonnaise can be made by hand with a whisk, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork">fork</a>,
          or with the aid of an electric mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk,
          while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base
          of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes
          it.<sup>[31][32][page needed]</sup> A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic
          repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is
          attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces.<sup>[33]</sup> Addition of
          mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains
          small amounts of lecithin.<sup>[34]</sup> If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more
          oil, thus making more mayonnaise.<sup>[35]</sup> <br> <br>

          For large-scale preparation of mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process
          typically begins with the dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once
          emulsified, the remaining ingredients are then added and vigorously mixed until completely
          hydrated and evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly as it can be absorbed. Though only
          a small part of the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation.
          These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small liquid volume, which can cause
          difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation
          process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest
          hases of the production process.<sup>[36]</sup> As food technology advances processing has been shortened
          drastically, allowing about 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.<sup>[37]</sup>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Whip">Miracle Whip</a> was developed as a cheap
          imitation of mayonnaise.[38] Since it does not meet the legal definition of mayonnaise, it is
