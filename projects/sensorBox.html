          Part 1 lays out the basic use of analog signals. The circuit has one
          potentiometer (pot) controlling an LED along side a photocell resistor
          connected to another LED. A photocell resistor is a type of variable
          resistor that resists the level of flow based on the amount of light
          it is receiving. Since analog signal is a range, these input devices
          allow the user to control the brightness of, and therefore the
          current to, the LED’s. Setting up the circuit, the input components
          must be connected to analog pins on the microcontroller (reference
          Nano 33 IoTs pin-out), here I am using A0 and A1. First the pot is
          connected to ground, signal (A1) and power; similarly, the photocell
          resistor is connected to power, and signal (A0) and ground. There is
          a 10k ohm resistor between the photocell and ground. The LED’s are
          put in as normal, with an 100 ohm resistor.<br><br>
          When working with analog signals, it is important to know the values
          that are being read by the sensors. To do this, I use the serial print
          monitor to get the range of values I am receiving, and, using the map
          function, adjust them to a range that can be output to my LED’s. The
          input values are always some range between 0 and 1023, whereas the
          LED’s work in a range 0 – 255. These ranges vary depending on the
          type of component you are using, which is why it is always
          important to check this first. Next, I used the analog write
          function to output my adjusted signal to the LED’s. Here is a demo
          video of the circuit

          THe second part of the lab uses analog signal to control frequency modulation.
          The circuit uses two photo cell resistors, rather than the second
          being fixed, creating a sort of musical instrument in the circuit.
          This system has a buzzer to output the sound. The code here works in
          basically the same was as part 1. First determining the range of input
          values, then mapping those values to the output to generate a tone.
          The buzzer can use frequencies 100Hz – 1000Hz, and I use the tone
          function to generate the sound. Here is a demo for part 2.

          The final part of this lab tasks you with actually building an
          interactive “box” containing two analog inputs and two different
          outputs (at least one being analog). Box is in quotes as it is not
          narrowly defined as a 6 sided cube, but rather any creative container
          to hold the interaction. We put together an interactive car using a
          servo motor controlled by a slider and LED’s controlled by photocell
          resistor. The servo is designed as a windshield wiper on the front,
          while the two headlights are reflective of the light around the car,
          reflecting driving with lights in the dark. The schematic here has a
          lot of familiar components. The LED’s are set up same way as always
          with respective 100 ohm resistors. Setting up a servo motor is simple,
          it is just connected to power, signal and ground. There are two
          analog inputs in the photocell resistor and the slider, both to their
          respective pins on the microcontroller. <br><br>
          This code is very similar to the rest of the code in this lab.
          Starting with defining variables and determining input range. Then map
           the input values to the LED lights (0-255) and the servo motor
           (0-255) and use analog write to send the signals to the components.
           With all the circuitry working, we got started on constructing the
           box. We cut, bent and glued cardboard together to create a box
           resembling the front half of a car. Then, in order to have or
           components coming through the box, we soldered the LED’s, the
           photocell resistor’s and the slider’s connections to longer
           jumper wires. Next, we painted the car black and fit all of the
           components into their respective spots in the car. The finalize the
           product we added a small knob to the slider, as well as a pipe
           cleaner (windshield wiper) on the servo motor.<br><br>
           Here is the final product along with a video of it in action.
